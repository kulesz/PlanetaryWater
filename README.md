# Planetary Water
Simple Unity implementation of Gerstner Waves simulated on the surface of a sphere.

Based on **Real-Time Rendering of Procedurally Generated Planets** by **Florian Michelic**.  
Original paper should be available here: [Link](https://cescg.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Michelic-Real-Time-Rendering-of-Procedurally-Generated-Planets-2.pdf).

This is just a prototype - it's not optimized and should be carefully tested before using in any project.  
Initially created in Unity 2021.1.16f1.
